{// Question-1. What do you mean by arrays give one example of array and how you can declared an array?
// an array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous (continuous) memory locations.
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
printf("%d\n", numbers[0]);  // output 10
printf("%d\n", numbers[3]);  // outpur 40
return 0;
}
//Question.2  What do you mean by functions? Write the types of functions and give one example in code of each type.
//A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
//Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, we can put it in a function and reuse it whenever needed.
//Type of function 
//1.liberery function(predefined).it is type of function which is stored by devloper it can not be changed.
// example.printf,scanf etc.
//2.user defind function- A user-defined function is a function created by the programmer to perform a specific task.
//example.
#include <stdio.h>

// User-defined function
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

int main() {
    // Predefined function example
    printf("Hello mam!\n");

    // User-defined function example
    int result = add(7, 3);  // Function call
    printf("Sum = %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
